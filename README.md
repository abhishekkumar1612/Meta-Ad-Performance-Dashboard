# 📊 Meta-Ad-Performance-Dashboard

## 🧠 About the Project
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze, visualize, and interpret marketing data effectively using analytical tools.
As part of my MBA in Human Resource Management (HRM), I focus on using data-driven insights to understand consumer behavior, campaign performance, and ROI improvement.
This dashboard reflects a business-oriented data storytelling approach — the kind recruiters and managers look for in data, marketing, and HR analytics roles.
